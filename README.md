# Bitmap-Maker
Just a quick, simple python program built on my pygame-pygame_gui framework to convert bitmap images into an array of hexadecimal numbers.


Press c or r to clear, and press the convert button or press enter to convert. It prints the output to the terminal, and copies it to your clipboard. Dragging [mostly] works.


To run, just clone the repo, install the required packages (pip install -r requirements.txt --user) and run main.py with python.
Or set up a virutal enviorment like you're supposed to.
